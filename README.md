# gRPC Streaming Examples in Java

This repository contains Java examples demonstrating different types of streaming using gRPC

## Overview

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication. In this project, we utilize gRPC to implement a simple chat server.


## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of test of streaming types:

### 1 - Unary Streaming
This screenshot shows a simple unary stream example, where the client sends a request to the server and receives a single response.

### 2 - Server Streaming
This screenshot shows an example of server-side streaming, where the server sends a stream of responses to the client in response to a single request.

### 4 - Bi-directional Streaming
This screenshot shows an example of bi-directional streaming, where both the client and server can send and receive streams of messages.
